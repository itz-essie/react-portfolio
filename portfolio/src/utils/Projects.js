Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page, indicating the burger has been devoured. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.The technologies used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Handlebars, jQuery, Node, Express, ORM, and mySql. JavaScript",
